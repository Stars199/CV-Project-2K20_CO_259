Road lane detection:

If you want to get into self-driving cars. Youâ€™ll detect lanes, edges of the road, and a lot more. Lane detection works like this:

Apply the mask,
Do image thresholding (thresholding converts an image to grayscale by replacing each pixel >= specified gray level with the corresponding gray level),
Do hough line transformation (detecting lane lines).
